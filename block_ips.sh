# IP Blocker Script using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
# Author: Daniel Chisasura
# This script reads a list of IP addresses from a file and adds 'deny' rules for each.

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
IP_LIST_FILE="malicious_ips.txt" # File containing IPs to block, one per line.

# --- SCRIPT LOGIC ---

# Root check: Firewall rules require root privileges to be modified.
# This ensures the script doesn't fail due to permission errors.
if [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then
   echo "ðŸš« This script must be run as root (or with sudo)."
   exit 1
fi

# File check: Ensure the IP list file exists before trying to read it.
if [ ! -f "$IP_LIST_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Error: IP list file not found at $IP_LIST_FILE"
    exit 1
fi
